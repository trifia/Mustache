# Status

Development will continue some time in January 2016. The basic functionality is done. I considered a first alpha build.

# Mustache

A Mustache Templating Engine in Swift.

The goal of this project are:

 - Provides an easily maintainable codes. Simple architecture but not too simple. Less codes but not too little.
 - No dependency.
 - Cross platform.
 - Lexer/Parser architecture. Strictly no regex.
 - Pass the specs at https://github.com/mustache/spec

Stretch goals once we reach stable build (when we reach 1.0.0).

 - Performant enough to be used by a server. (Compare to Ruby/JS/Go implementation, optimized build should be able to beat ruby and js and at least within 10% difference with Go.)
 - Low memory footprint.

# Why?

A project for me to practice writing swift. exploring lexer and parser architecture.
